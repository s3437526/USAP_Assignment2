:computer:**Running the program**


To run the program run the build_kernel script using the `./build_kernel` command in the directory which contains the script file. For example, if the script is located in /home/pi/ directory then run the script from that location.

The process will automatically download and install all the pre-requisites and commence the setup, build and installation of the kernel.

On successful completion the installation will reboot the Raspberry Pi.
