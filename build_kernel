Script by Alex Alduk S3437526

This script initiates and installs the Linux Kernel for the Raspberry Pi 4

*** TO-DO ***

Checkout personal repo
Checkout Raspberry Pi repo
Copy .config file into git repo
Build kernel
Backup /boot directory and compress
Copy files to boot directory
Restart Pi 

No user input??

Input IP address when running script... - check about user input...
Change script group owner to sudo to be able to run without 'sudo' command
remove unneccessary 'sudo' commands
add error checking of calls with the following:

added some error handling...
...and again...
