.SH NAME
build_kernel \- create a new custom Linux kernel
.SH DESCRIPTION
build_kernel is a script which automates the 
installation of a customised kernel based on the
Raspberry Pi 4 armvhf architecture. 

It takes no arguments
and when run, it downloads the latest kernel image from
github, installs any required dependancies and builds the
kernel using a pre-configured .config file.
.SH OPTIONS
The build_kernel script takes no options and does not require
user input.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Most of the problems associated with the creating of the 
custom kernel will be likely resulting from incorrect
file and directory permissions, missing or incorrectly
named directories. Reviewing each error message should
give adequate guidance of where the program failed and
allow the user to troubleshoot the process.

The following diagnostics may be issued to the user:

"Directory already exists"
.RS
Displayed to the user if the temporary working directory
"tmp" already exists in the user's home directory and 
prompts the user to ensure it is backed up and removed 
prior to commencing.
.RE
"ERROR: creating directory failed"
.RS
Displayed to the user if there was a problem with creating
the temporary working "tmp" directory in the user's home
directory.
.RE 
"ERROR: changing to the linux directory failed"
.RS
Displayed to the user if there was a problem with changing
into the working "tmp" directory in theu ser's home
directory.
.RE
"An error has occurred while running the creating boot 
backup directory process."
.RS
Displayed to the user if there was a problem with creating
the boot backup directory in the user's home directory.
.RE
"An error has occurred while running the backing up and 
compressing of boot directory process."
.RS
Displayed to the user if there was a problem with backing
up and compressing of the boot directory.
.RE
"An error has occurred while running the copying of 
the .config file to the build directory process."
.RS
Displayed to the user if there was a problem with copying
of the .config file from the downloaded repo into the
working directory for use with the script.
.RE
"An error has occurred while running the making of the 
install modules process."
.RS
Displayed to the user if there was a problem with making
of the install modules process.
.RE
"An error has occurred while running the copying of 
architecture to boot directory process."
.RS
Displayed to the user if there was a problem with copying
of the architecture into the boot directory.
.RE
"An error has occurred while running the copying 
architecture to overlays directory process."
.RS
Displayed to the user if there was a problem with copying
of the architecture into the boot overlays directory. 
.RE
"An error has occurred while running the copying of kernel 
image to boot directory process."
.RS
Displayed to the user if there was a problem with copying
of the kernel image into the boot directory.
.RE
"An error has occurred while running the installing of 
dependancies process."
.RS
Displayed to the user if there was a problem with installing
of dependencies required to run all subsequent installation
processes.
.RE
"An error has occurred while running the insallation of 
the kernel process."
.RS
