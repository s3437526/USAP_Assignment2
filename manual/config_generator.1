.SH NAME
config_generator \- create a new custom Linux kernel .config file
.SH SYNOPSIS
config_generator [local_IP_address]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B config_generator 
is a script which automates the creation of a customised kernel 
configuration (.config) file based on theRaspberry Pi 4 armvhf 
architecture. 

It takes one argument which is the local machine's IP address.
When run, it downloads the latest kernel image from
github, installs any required dependancies and presents the user
with kernel build options via xterm. On completion the user saves
changes and exits. This results in an outuput of the .config file.

Example use ./config_generator 192.168.0.10
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Most of the problems associated with the creating of the 
custom kernel .config file will be likely resulting from 
incorrect file and directory permissions, missing or incorrectly
named directories.

Other problems may be due to incorrectly setup xterm and x11
programs or incorrectly entered local IP address.

Reviewing each error message should
give adequate guidance of where the program failed and
allow the user to troubleshoot the process.

The following diagnostics may be issued to the user:
