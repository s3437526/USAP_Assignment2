.SH NAME
install_manual \- Install user maunal for the build_kernel script
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B install_manual
is a simple script which automates the installation of the user
manual for the build_kernel script. 

It takes no arguments and when run, it copies the manual page
located in the local directory into the manuals directory. It
then compresses it for use with the manuals program. To execute
type ./install_manual.
.SH OPTIONS
The install_manual script takes no options and does not require
user input.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Most of the problems associated with the installation of the 
manual will be likely resulting from incorrect
file and directory permissions, missing or incorrectly
named directories. Reviewing each error message should
give adequate guidance of where the program failed and
allow the user to troubleshoot the process.

The following diagnostics may be issued to the user:

"Error: unable to copy manual page for the build_kernel
script to the maunals directory. Please check that the
manual file exists in the source directory."
.RS
Displayed to the user if there was a problem with accessing
the manual file or directory. 

Check that the file is in fact in the directory that 
the command is being run in, that the destination
directory exists and that you have permission to copy the 
contents over to it.
.RE
"ERROR: unable to compress file. Please check that the file
exists in the directory."
.RS
Displayed to the user if there was a problem with compressing
the manual file into a format that is used by the manual 
program. Check the file and directory permissions and that
you have sudo access.
