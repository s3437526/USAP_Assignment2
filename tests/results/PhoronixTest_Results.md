## Introduction

This report will cover four test suites. The results of the test suites will be reported on together in the results section and an analysis will be formed based on them.

***Disclaimer*** - Not all tests ran successfully, however, data was extrapolated as best as possible to obtain valid results to report on. Of the **xxx** tests run **xx** were successful. 

The four chosen tests are as follows:

### Test suite 1 - Memory
### Test suite 2 - 
### Test suite 3 - 
### Test suite 4 - 

***

## Method

The tests were initially chosen based on personally perceived impact to computing and relevance e.g. memory, cpu etc. Unfortunately, as several tests have failed the test suites chosen were subject to further selective refinement and information gathered from the RMIT USAP Announocements discussion board ***available here***.

Test suites were initially run via SSH CLI, however, due to timeout-related connectivity issues, a shift was made to GUI in order to minimuise impact based on errors due to lack of user input.
